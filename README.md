# Hi, I'm Kriish üëã

**Former Full Stack & DevOps Intern @ChrysApp | Student at UIC | Dedicated to building scalable web apps**

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me
Hello! I'm Kriish Patel, a CS student passionate about building web applications and learning new technologies. I love working on full-stack projects that help make my life easier. Previously, I had the opportunity to intern at a UIC start-up called Chrysapp. I worked as a Full Stack Developer and DevOps Engineering Intern.
During this internship, I was exposed to many new technologies, such as PostgreSQL, Redis, and Google Cloud. I worked on improving features on both the front-end and back-end to enhance user interaction. This internship gave me insight
on how companies collaborate with other teams to ensure a smooth flow of the project, a valuable skill. I‚Äôm always excited to take on new challenges and contribute to projects that create meaningful impact. 

I am currently seeking a Summer 2026 Internship in Full stack developemnt, Software Engineering, or Web Application Development, where I can contribute to impactful projects while continuing to grow my technical skills. I‚Äôm also working on a project called SyncCord, a platform that allows users to easily integrate pre-made Discord bots into their servers. I‚Äôm building it using React.js, Express.js, Discord.py, and Supabase, focusing on responsive design, secure authentication, and seamless backend integration to ensure a smooth user experience.

Previous projects that I have worked on consist of: 

## RoleRadar | REST API, Express.js, Twilio
